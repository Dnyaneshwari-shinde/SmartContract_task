# ERC-20 Smart Contract

1. Basic ERC-20 Token Implementation: This contract implements a simple ERC-20 token with core functions such as transfer, balanceOf, and allowance.

2. Token Distribution and Locking: The contract includes a token distribution mechanism where tokens are allocated and locked according to specified lock periods.

3. Claiming Vested Tokens: The claimTokens() function allows beneficiaries to claim their vested tokens after the designated lock periods have passed.

4. Code Comments for Clarity: I have added comments throughout the contract to improve readability and provide clarity on the logic behind each section of the code.

5. Optimized for Gas Efficiency: The contract is designed to be simple and optimized to minimize gas usage, ensuring faster transaction processing and improved throughput on the blockchain.
